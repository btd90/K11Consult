appears to support USB input as seen in consultSerialGraphics.py, need to test this at some point
importSingleOverlay doesn't work as it requires a camera input??
consultSerial doesn't work for fetching pygame events

TODO:
Add ability to show KMH not just MPH
Add properties/yml to track defaults
Add 'themes' to handle different displays
